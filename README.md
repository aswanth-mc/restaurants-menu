# restaurants-menu
This project is a Python-based Command Line Restaurant Management System designed to manage restaurant operations such as customer registration, menu viewing, order placement, billing, payment processing, feedback collection, and a customer loyalty point system.

The system uses SQLite as the backend database and is implemented entirely using Python, making it lightweight and easy to run on any system.
